### 🔦 Highlights

#### Improving libp2p resource management integration
This builds on the default protection nodes get against DoS (resource exhaustion) and eclipse attacks
with the [go-libp2p Network Resource Manager/Accountant](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/libp2p-resource-management.md)
that was fine-tuned in [Kubo 0.18](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/biglep/resource-manager-example-of-what-want/docs/changelogs/v0.18.md#improving-libp2p-resource-management-integration).

Adding default hard-limits from the Resource Manager/Accountant after the fact is tricky,
and some additional improvements have been made to improve the [computed defaults](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/libp2p-resource-management.md#computed-default-limits).
As much as possible, the aim is for a user to only think about how much memory they want to bound libp2p to, 
and not need to think about translating that to hard numbers for connections, streams, etc.
More updates are likely in future Kubo releases, but with this release: 
1.``System.StreamsInbound`` is no longer bounded directly
2. ``System.ConnsInbound`` has higher default computed values.
